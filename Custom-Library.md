###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.

###### A few things you should be aware of:
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (check the section below for more about this).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### Hopefully, you are looking at the screen above. If not, check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Getting-Started) guide or jump directly to the directory picker (by tapping on `Select Downloads Folder`) via the `Prefs Screen` (displayed below).

###### If you are here from the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Getting-Started) guide, go ahead and tap on `Custom`. If you are here from the `Prefs Screen`, then you are where I need you. You can confirm this by taking a look at the screen below.

###### By default, the directory picker will show the default Hentoid folder (this is usually internal storage). If you have an existing library not in the default `Hentoid` folder, then go ahead and browse to it from here. If you want to try saving to an SD Card, then give the SD Card icon on the bottom left a tap. If your device is supported, the directory picker will jump to the SD Card or you will see the following.

###### You got all that? Tap OK and then tap `Select` on the dialog that follows it. If you have a `Hentoid` folder on your SD Card, DO NOT select it when performing this step, you want to select your SD Card, not the `Hentoid` folder.

###### If you did everything right (and if your device is supported) then you'll either be staring at an import confirmation dialog or the `All set up!` screen. If this is not the case, or if you crashed, I urge you to bring this up to our devs on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0yFzSPtXehJmFqOM).

###### From this point, you can head back to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Getting-Started) guide if you came from there or check out our [Downloading](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Downloading) guide if you need assistance. Other than that, thank you for installing `Hentoid`, enjoy your stay~
