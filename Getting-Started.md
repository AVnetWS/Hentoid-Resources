###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.#

###### A few things you should be aware of:#
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (you will need to manually install it to your device).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### With that out of the way, head on over and grab the [latest release](../releases/latest) and install on your Android device to get started. You want to grab the file named `hentoid.apk` from the release page.#
*Note: When installing `Hentoid`, you may be presented with the following alert:*

![Install Blocked Alert Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/unknown-sources-warning.jpg)

###### Due to the content `Hentoid` gives you access to - `Hentoid` is not distributed in the Google Play Store, so you will see this alert (and will not be able to install) until you change your security settings on your device.#
###### To do this, open the `Settings` app and navigate to `Security`. Look for the `Unknown Sources` entry and enable it. You will need to relaunch the `hentoid.apk` file you downloaded earlier in order to install `Hentoid` after changing this setting. You can find this file in your `Downloads` app (and in your `Downloads` folder) if you previously downloaded it.#

###### If you followed the above instructions correctly, `Hentoid` should now be installed. If for any reason you cannot install `Hentoid`, ask for help in the [Hentoid - Google+ Community - Help category](https://plus.google.com/communities/110496467189870321840/stream/4bd645ab-de38-4ed1-8238-06adc4bc5bcd) and one of us will be glad to assist.#

###### Once `Hentoid` is installed, go ahead and launch it (either from the last screen on your package manager, or from your application list).#
###### From this point, `Hentoid` will ask you where to save your downloads. Keep the default option if this is the first time that you are using `Hentoid` then tap save to proceed - otherwise, browse to the directory where your downloads are saved, `Hentoid` will import any valid files that were downloaded, including files from prior versions of `Hentoid` (this includes `FakkuDroid` & `FakkuDroidV3`). The import process will go over all of your previous downloads, so give it time if you have a particularly large library.#
###### From this point, the app will take you to the `Download` list. This is where any files that you download will be organized and presented for your consumption.#
###### If you wish to simply get started with downloading, then tap on the `Action Menu` on the top left (this is also known as the `Navigation Bar`). Pick any of the top three websites ([Fakku](https://www.fakku.net/), [Pururin](http://pururin.com/) and [Hitomi](http://hitomi.la/) to navigate to their mobile page (if supported).#
###### You will then need to navigate to a release that you are interested in downloading (_Please note that Fakku Books are not supported at this time_). When you are in this view, look to the bottom left of your screen - make note of the floating icons. They will change according to what you have already downloaded (and if the content is downloadable):#
* If you wish to download a release, then press the icon with the downwards arrow.
* If you wish to go back to your downloads list, press the icon with an SD card image.
* If you wish to refresh the page, press the icon with the two arrows in a circle pattern _(please note that as of version 1.1.2, you can simply swipe-down (or pull down) on the webpage that you are currently on (once you have scrolled all the way up) to refresh the page)_.

###### If you navigate to a release that you have already downloaded, you will see a play icon instead of the download icon. Tapping on this icon will allow you to view the content downloaded in your prefered image viewer. Do note that you do not have to browse to a particular release in order to view it - the `Downloads` list will list any releases that you have already downloaded, as long as you refresh the list once any releases are done downloading.#
