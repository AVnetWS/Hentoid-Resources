###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.

###### A few things you should be aware of:
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (check the section below for more about this).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### With that out of the way, go on and grab the [latest release](../releases/latest) and install on your Android device to get started. You want to grab the file named `hentoid.apk` from the release page.
*Note: When installing `Hentoid`, you may be presented with the following alert:*

![Install Blocked Alert Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/01-setup-unknown-sources-warning.png)

###### Due to the content `Hentoid` gives you access to - `Hentoid` is not distributed in the Google Play Store, so you will see this alert (and will not be able to install) until you change your security settings on your device.
###### To do this, open the `Settings` app and navigate to `Security`. Look for the `Unknown Sources` entry and enable it.

![Enable Unknown Sources Confirm Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/02-setup-enable-unknown-sources-dialog.png)

###### You will need to relaunch the `hentoid.apk` file you downloaded earlier in order to install `Hentoid` after changing this setting. You can find this file in your `Downloads` app (and in your `Downloads` folder) if you previously downloaded it.

###### If you followed the above instructions correctly, `Hentoid` should now be installed. If for any reason you cannot install `Hentoid`, ask for help in the [Hentoid - Google+ Community - Help category](https://plus.google.com/communities/110496467189870321840/stream/4bd645ab-de38-4ed1-8238-06adc4bc5bcd) or in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0yFzSPtXehJmFqOM).

###### Once `Hentoid` is installed, go ahead and launch it (either from the last screen on your package manager, or from your application list).

![Welcome to Hentoid](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/04-setup-app-welcome.png)

###### Welcome to Hentoid! Since this is your first time installing the app, you will be presented with a wizard. Just follow along.

![Runtime Permissions](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/05-setup-app-permissions.png)

###### If you are using a device powered by Android 6.0+, then you will see the screen above. Make sure to allow `Hentoid` to save to your device, if not, you won't be able to use the app.

![Library Directory](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/06-setup-app-library.png)

###### From this point, `Hentoid` will ask you where to save your downloads. Keep the default option if this is the first time that you are using `Hentoid` then tap select to proceed - otherwise, browse to the directory where your downloads are saved.

![Library Import Confirm Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/07-setup-app-library-import-dialog.png)

###### `Hentoid` will now ask you to confirm if it finds a library, or proceed directly to creating a library if it does not.

![Library Importing Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/08-setup-app-library-importing.png)

###### `Hentoid` will import any valid files that it finds in your library folder. This includes files from prior versions of `Hentoid` (e.g.; `FakkuDroid` & `FakkuDroidV3`). The import process will go over all of your previous downloads, so give it time if you have a particularly large library.

![Adding to DB Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/09-setup-app-library-db-add.png)

###### You will see this once `Hentoid` scans all of your files.

![All done](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/10-setup-app-landing.png)

###### You've made it -- thank you for installing `Hentoid`, enjoy your stay~
