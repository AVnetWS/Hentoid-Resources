###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.

###### A few things you should be aware of:
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (check the section below for more about this).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### With that out of the way, go on and grab the [latest release](../releases/latest) and install on your Android device to get started. Need help with that? Check out our [Install](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Install) guide.

###### Once `Hentoid` is installed, go ahead and launch it (either from the last screen on your package manager, or from your application list).

###### Welcome to Hentoid! Since this is your first time installing the app, you will be presented with a wizard. Just follow along.

###### If you are using a device powered by Android 6.0+, then you will see the screen above. Make sure to allow `Hentoid` to save to your device, if not, you won't be able to use the app.

###### From this point, `Hentoid` will ask you where to save your downloads. Choose the `Default` option if this is the first time that you are using `Hentoid` or if you want to save on internal storage - otherwise, tapping on `Custom` will allow you to choose a different directory and (if your device supports this) an SD Card.
###### If you need help in this area, check out the [Custom Library](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Custom-Library) guide.

###### If `Hentoid` finds a library, it will now ask you to confirm importing it. You won't see this on a new install.

###### For those with existing libraries, `Hentoid` will import any valid files that it finds in your library folder. This includes files from prior versions of `Hentoid` (e.g.; `FakkuDroid` & `FakkuDroidV3`). The import process will go over all of your previous downloads, so give it time if you have a particularly large library.

###### You will see this once `Hentoid` scans all of your files.
