###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.

###### A few things you should be aware of:
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (too hot for Google).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### With that out of the way, launch the app if not already open. If you have yet to install `Hentoid`, check out our [Install](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki/Install) guide.

###### If this is your first time using `Hentoid` and you opted *not* to import your library (or you simply don't have a prior library), then your `Download List` will be a bit, well, lonely -- let's fix that!

###### For this example, I will be downloading from [nhentai](https://nhentai.net/)~
###### Go ahead and open the navigation drawer to get started:

![Navigation Drawer](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/01-down-navigation-menu.png)

###### See [nhentai](https://nhentai.net/) on the list above, tap away. `Hentoid` will then open a window that will allow you to browse [nhentai](https://nhentai.net/). Take note of the two floating buttons on the lower left:

![Source: nhentai](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/02-down-source-nhentai.png)

###### The floating button on the lower left (the one that looks like an `SD Card`) will bring you back to the `Download List`. Use it whenever you get lost~ As for the button above it, well, that refreshes the page that you are currently on.

###### Once you see something you want, tap on it, which should bring you to the details page for that particular item -- in the example above, I went for some oranges. Note that there is now a new button on the lower right. This is the button that you will see when you are in a page `Hentoid` recognizes as a downloadable item, but which you have yet to download.

![Grabbing that orange](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/04-down-grabbing-orange.png)

###### Don't waste any time, tap on that button -- which will prompt `Hentoid` to shout at you, letting you know it's working away, attempting to grab some oranges. If you are quick enough, you can even catch the download in progress by swiping down on your notifications:

![Sweet Progress](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/05-down-checking-orange-state.png)

###### Once a download is complete, it is up to you to choose if you want to consume it right away, or go out in search for more. Once you are satisfied, you can revisit your `Download List` by tapping on a notification for a completed download, or the icon on the lower left that we referred to earlier. 

![Give me my oranges](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/06-down-new-orange-in-library.png)

###### Whichever option you choose, when you come back to the `Download List`, you will see this nagging you. In order to get `Hentoid` to release your sweet oranges, you can either tap on the notification itself, or slide down on the `Download List` itself to refresh it.

![Finally](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/down/07-down-refreshing-library.png)

###### If done correctly, `Hentoid` should give up holding your oranges hostage and will add them to your `Download List` -- please keep this method a secret from others, we don't want to hurt `Hentoid` too much.

###### I hope you find what you are looking for out there. Go ahead and give the other sources a try as well with what you have learned -- until the next one~
