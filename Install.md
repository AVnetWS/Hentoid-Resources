###### This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.

###### A few things you should be aware of:
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (check the section below for more about this).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

###### With that out of the way, go on and grab the [latest release](../releases/latest) and install on your Android device to get started. You want to grab the file named `hentoid.apk` from the release page.
*Note: When installing `Hentoid`, you may be presented with the following alert:*

![Install Blocked Alert Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/setup/01-setup-unknown-sources-warning.png)

###### Due to the content `Hentoid` gives you access to - `Hentoid` is not distributed in the Google Play Store, so you will see this alert (and will not be able to install) until you change your security settings on your device.
###### To do this, open the `Settings` app and navigate to `Security`. Look for the `Unknown Sources` entry and enable it.

###### You will need to relaunch the `hentoid.apk` file you downloaded earlier in order to install `Hentoid` after changing this setting. You can find this file in your `Downloads` app (and in your `Downloads` folder) if you previously downloaded it.

###### If you followed the above instructions correctly, `Hentoid` should now be installed. If for any reason you cannot install `Hentoid`, ask for help in the [Hentoid - Google+ Community - Help category](https://plus.google.com/communities/110496467189870321840/stream/4bd645ab-de38-4ed1-8238-06adc4bc5bcd) or in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0yFzSPtXehJmFqOM).
