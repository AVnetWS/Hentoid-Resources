##Welcome to the Hentoid wiki!#

######This page has been created in order to familiarize you with the `Hentoid` app as quickly as possible.#
___
######`Hentoid` is a Hentai Manga reader & archiving app designed to work with:#
######[Fakku](https://www.fakku.net/), [Pururin](http://pururin.com/) and [Hitomi](http://hitomi.la/) (Hitomi does not currently support mobile layouts).#

######A few things you should be aware of:#
* `Hentoid` is only available for Android (no plans for an iOS version at the moment).
* `Hentoid` is not offered in the Google Play Store (you will need to manually install it to your device).
* `Hentoid` is not a simplified or alternative browser (what you see is what you get).
* `Hentoid` cannot download if the original source is not there (just in case you try this).

######With that out of the way, head on over and grab the [latest release](../releases/latest) and install on your Android device to get started. You want to grab the file named `hentoid.apk` from the release page.#
*Note: When installing `Hentoid`, you may be presented with the following alert:*

![Install Blocked Alert Dialog](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid-Resources/raw/master/wiki/assets/img/unknown-sources-warning.jpg)

######Due to the content `Hentoid` gives you access to - `Hentoid` is not distributed in the Google Play Store, so you will see this alert (and will not be able to install) until you change your security settings on your device.#
######To do this, open the `Settings` app and navigate to `Security`. Look for the `Unknown Sources` entry and enable it. You will need to relaunch the `hentoid.apk` file you downloaded earlier in order to install `Hentoid` after changing this setting. You can find this file in your `Downloads` app (and in your `Downloads` folder) if you previously downloaded it.#
